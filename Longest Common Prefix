Question: 
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

Answer:

class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if not strs:
            return ""
    
        # Start with the first string as the common prefix
        prefix = strs[0]
        
        # Iterate through all strings in the list
        for string in strs[1:]:
            # Compare the current prefix with the current string
            while not string.startswith(prefix):
                # Trim the last character from the prefix
                prefix = prefix[:-1]
                # If no common prefix exists, return an empty string
                if not prefix:
                    return ""
    
        return prefix
        end of solution.
